# ESP32_LED_control

This is a simple project using an ESP32 microcontroller that turns an LED on and off with a pushbutton. The project was created and tested using the Wokwi online simulator.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

- The LED is connected to **GPIO 2**.
- The pushbutton is connected to **GPIO 4**.
- The button uses the internal pull-up resistor.
- When the button is pressed, the LED turns ON.
- When the button is released, the LED turns OFF.
